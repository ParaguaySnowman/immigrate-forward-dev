This is the development repository for the website to be launched on immigrateforward.com.

This has been written to have the backend deployed on Render and the Frontend deployed on Netlify. Likewise the Strapi server, not yet added, was to be deployed on Render.

I have taken this project as far as I can for now, a more experienced developer will need to take it from here, or I will need to return to this project at a later date.
